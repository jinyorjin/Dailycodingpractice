# 🧠 Daily Coding Practice

Welcome to my daily coding practice repository!  
This space is where I commit my small wins and everyday efforts to become a better developer.

🌐 **Live Site:**  
👉 [https://dailycodingpractice.netlify.app](https://dailycodingpractice.netlify.app)

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository is designed to:
- Improve consistency in coding
- Practice JavaScript, React, and algorithm fundamentals
- Track growth one commit at a time

## 📅 What I do

Each day, I aim to:
- Solve at least one coding challenge
- Build or enhance a mini React component or JavaScript function
- Reflect on what I learned

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React
- Netlify (for deployment)
- VSCode
- Git & GitHub

## 🌱 Notes

Some days are harder than others — but I believe steady practice leads to real growth.  
This repo isn’t perfect, but it’s a snapshot of my progress.
